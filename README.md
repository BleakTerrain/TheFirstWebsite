# My very first webpage 

Welcome! Here we go! 
This is my first website and we're figuring it out as we go.

### What's in this project?
We built a simple website that has three seperate 'streams' or pages. 
These each have links to regualrly used softwares
We also wrote a very simple CSS which hold all the relevant style ideas

There aren't many technolgies used other then HTML and CSS. 

You can find the webpage deployed using GIT PAGES at https://bleakterrain.github.io/TheFirstWebsite/
ENJOY!
